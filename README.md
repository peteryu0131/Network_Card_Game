# Network_Card_Game

In my Network Card Game project, I developed a card game using Java and GUI, enabling multiple users to play together over a network connection. I created a client GUI application using the Java Swing package to provide players with an intuitive and enjoyable gaming experience. To ensure a smooth and seamless experience for players, I implemented advanced multithreading techniques that enabled the server to create and maintain multiple connections.![image](https://github.com/peteryu0131/Network_Card_Game/assets/47871789/22f8485e-c4a7-456e-87d1-0643823b7f75)
